TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.

type IRes<T> = Promise<AxiosResponse<T>> :
    1. type IRes - is used to define the shape of data.
    2. Promise<...> - indicates that IRes<T> is a Promise type.
    3. AxiosResponse<T> - represents an HTTP response, including data of type T

Interfaces define the shape of data, they are only apply to object types.
